# **SOC - 2024: Retro Learning**
## Exploring reinforcement learning through retro games

## **Week 3**

This week's provided code contains an implementation of simple DQN for cartpole. 
Your first task is to understand the code, and make changes to it to allow it to work for any other game in the gym environment.

Alongside this, we will now be providing further resources for more RL theory, and basic computer vision. We will cover 1 implementation of CNNs as well.
