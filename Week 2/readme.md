# **SOC - 2024: Retro Learning**
## Exploring reinforcement learning through retro games
---

## **Week 2**

Now that you have familiarised yourself with basic probability and the concept of reinforcement learning, we jump into looking at how these are implemented, and start learning about basic computer vision.

The complete code has been provided for two games from the openai gym. Run this code on your own devices, and see the structure of the same. Try changing various learning parameters, and the policy for choosing random actions (you can attempt to apply what you've learnt from bandits here).

We will shortly provide the resources for computer vision as well.
