# **SOC - 2024: Retro Learning**
## Exploring reinforcement learning through retro games
---

## **Week 1**

We expect some familiarity with probability theory (probability distributions, expectation values and random variables) before we get started. Incase these terms feel unfamiliar then you may refer to chapters 2 and 3 of this book: 

### **Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty**<br> <i>Michael J. Evans and Jeffrey S. Rosenthal University of Toronto</i>

https://www.utstat.toronto.edu/mikevans/jeffrosenthal/book.pdf

Only basic understanding is enough as for the most part we will be referring to the following book:

### **Reinforcement Learning**: <i>An Introduction second edition<br>Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto</i>

The bullets below highlight the agenda for week 1:
* Read about multi-armed bandit problems, Markov Decision Processes and Dynamic Programming (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) 

* Simulate a simple pole balancing model and $\epsilon$-greedy multi-armed bandit problem in python for various values of $\epsilon$

* Compile everything in a $\LaTeX$ report

Just for fun, you may ready about the various applications of RL (Chapters 14, 15 and 16). Below We have attached some more resources for your reference:

* Cart-Pole Implementation: https://youtu.be/2sp_eucoX2I?si=fji-gQzHNko2IaVc

* Policy, Value iterations and Dynamic Programming: https://youtu.be/sJIFUTITfBc?si=d1Qzbe3EvELc30io

Since this week involves getting familiar with RL, we have provided the codes for you to go through however you are free to modify the provided codes to try anything related to the above topics.
<br>
Compile everything that you have understood about the above topics, your simulation results and anything else that you tried out in a $\LaTeX$ report (need not include everthing the book covers).
